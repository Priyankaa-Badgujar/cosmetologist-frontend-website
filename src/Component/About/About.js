                    <h1>My story</h1><br/>
                    <h4>THE BEGINNING</h4><br/>
                    <p className="me-para-1">I've always had a thing for aesthetics. From a young age, I've been fascinated with skincare, and after developing dermatitis herpetiformis and having to give up gluten, I decided to share my findings with the rest of the world.  </p>
                    <p className="me-para-2">In 10 years, a lot has changed in cosmetology. As an avid and life-long learner, I take pride in keeping up with the newest trends in order to be able to provide you with the expert care you deserve.  </p><br/>
                    <h4>MY VISION</h4><br/>
                    <p className="me-para-3">I believe that everyone should be allowed to feel confident and good in their skin, regardless of their age, sex, or social className. That's why I've worked hard to come up with different treatments that suit different skin needs, and budgets. When I see my clients smile when they look at themselves in the mirror after our sessions, I feel like I've been able to make the world just a little bit better.</p>
